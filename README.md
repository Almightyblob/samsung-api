# Samung API Assignemnt

This project was created with React, TypeScript, Redux and Tailwind.

In the root directory, run:

### `npm i && npm start`

I essentially re-learned React for this assignment and picked up how to work with styled components using tailwind and Redux / Redux toolkit just for this project, which certainly was an added challenge!

The biggest focus for me was to not only display the API data, but also to interact with it through Redux.

The navigation is entirely driven through Redux and it's also possible to select a phone by color and received the corresponding thumbnails and images.

The design is responsive, with one caveat: the menu. With more time, I would have liked to add the ability to hide / show it on smaller screens.
